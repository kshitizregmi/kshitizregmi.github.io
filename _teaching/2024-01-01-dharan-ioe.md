As a tutor, I'm thrilled to share that I recently led a dynamic 7-day AI/ML bootcamp at Tribhuvan University, IOE, Purwanchal Campus . Throughout the program, participants delved into practical, hands-on training within a comprehensive learning environment, resulting in their successful completion. It was a rewarding experience witnessing their growth. Thank you everybody who directly or indirectly helped to make it successful. üôè 

## Day 1: Kicking off AI/ML Bootcamp with Numpy Basics
Starting our journey into AI and Machine Learning with an introduction to NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.

## Day 2: Introducing Pandas: Uncovering Series and DataFrames
Discovering Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, focusing on Series and DataFrames which are essential for handling structured data.

## Day 3: Exploring Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistics
Learning visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and delve into basic statistics.

## Day 4: Diving into Machine Learning Basics
Exploring the foundational concepts of Machine Learning, including different types of ML algorithms and the overall ML workflow and Pipelines

## Day 5: Delving into Regression Algorithms
Deep dive into Regression algorithms for predicting employee salaries, covering data integration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation metrics specific to regression models.

## Day 6: Exploring Classification Algorithms
Understanding various Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, along with evaluation metrics and visualization of decision boundaries.

## Day 7: Mastering Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Means Clustering
Advancing our knowledge by mastering KNN,and K-Means Clustering, important algorithms in supervised and unsupervised learning, to conclude our AI & ML bootcamp on a high note.
