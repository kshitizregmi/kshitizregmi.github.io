Almost 5 years of architecting and deploying impactful AI/DL solutions, I leverage cutting-edge NLP, semantic search, and ML/DL models (Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, GCP) to craft end-to-end solutions that solve real-world problems and drive business growth. My passion lies in seeing my solutions deliver tangible results, like the INMA award-winning personalized news recommender system.  I am excited to translate technical expertise into tangible business value, consistently exceeding expectations.
