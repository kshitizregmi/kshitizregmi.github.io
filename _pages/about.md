I am a TensorFlow certified developer and a machine learning engineer. In addition, I have two years of practical experience building end-to-end machine learning models adapted to many areas of industry, including supply chains and e-commerce.
I specialise in ML domains like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Recommendation Systems.

Currently, I am working on Fusemachines Nepal as a machine learning engineer. Previously, I worked as an AI intern at OYA INC, where I developed a recommendation system. Furthermore, I have skills in python and its machine learning libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, spaCy, NLTK, OpenCV, Elastic Search, etc. along with web frameworks like Flask and databases like SQL and MongoDB.
