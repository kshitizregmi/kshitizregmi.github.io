I am a Machine Learning Engineer with over five years of experience in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, Recommendation systems. During my time at TIME magazine, I led the development of award-winning personalized recommendation systems, achieving a 42.97% open rate. I have collaborated closely with TIME executives and teams to develop innovative product strategies, applying AI to solve real-world challenges. 

In addition to my professional work, I am passionate about teaching and developing future AI leaders. I have trained over 2,000 students in Python and data science and am committed to expanding these efforts. My aim is to inspire and guide the next generation of AI professionals in Nepal, helping them gain the skills they need to succeed in the evolving tech landscape by democratizing AI education in Nepal.

My goal is to advance AI research by pursuing a Masterâ€™s/Ph.D. program, which will allow me to contribute to cutting-edge AI solutions. By furthering my education, I aim to not only drive innovation but also mentor the next generation of AI professionals, balancing both research and teaching to impact both technology and education.
